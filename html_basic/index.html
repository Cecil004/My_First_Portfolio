<h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Cecil, and I’m learning how to build awesome websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I enjoy coding, music, and cycling. My dream is to become a skilled front-end developer.</p>
<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
<p>I love playing guitar, singing pop music covers, and exploring Afrobeat vibes.</p>
<p>When I’m not coding or making music, I enjoy cycling and discovering new places.</p>
